<p> This adventure is about a mission trip to Mars and It will include three shuttle craft explorers and their crue members. I will attempt to run down the launching procedures and the flight time and mileage to the red planet. 
The flight has a element of danger to it and different out comes can occur when our crew is in flight. I chose this theme because I believed it would be helpful when incorporating my variables and functions.</p>
<p>You may also use this space to explain any elements of your code story that may not be entirely clear.  For example, if your theme is thirteenth century Italian poetry, not everyone may be familiar with that.</p>
<p>Don't forget to replace all of the capitalized elements in this template with your information.  Your term number should be in a <em>yymm</em> format, including the year and the month.</p>
